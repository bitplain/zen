# Diagram sources

Editable diagrams are kept here in the open `.drawio` format for transparency and reuse.

- `architecture.drawio` — starter canvas for site and workflow diagrams. Open it with [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/).
- Export PNG/SVG outputs into sibling folders inside `docs/assets/` to keep sources and renders together.
