# Assets

Use this directory for shared images, diagrams, and downloadable files referenced throughout the documentation.

- Final renders belong alongside the pages that embed them (for example, `docs/assets/how-to/`).
- Editable diagram sources live in [`docs/assets/diagram-sources/`](diagram-sources/README.md) so updates can be tracked and regenerated.
