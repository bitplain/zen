# FAQ

## How do I preview my changes?

Run `zensical serve` from the project root. The local server reloads whenever you update a file.

## Where should I store images and diagrams?

Place final assets in `docs/assets/` and keep editable diagram sources in `docs/assets/diagram-sources/`.

## Can I reuse the sample components?

Yes. The snippets in the [authoring examples](../reference/authoring-examples.md) are ready to copy into any page.
