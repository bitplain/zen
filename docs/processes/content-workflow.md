# Content workflow

Establish a lightweight workflow so contributions stay consistent and discoverable.

## Draft

- Capture new ideas in the [FAQ](../faq/index.md) or as short notes under `docs/how-to/`.
- Add diagrams alongside the draft in `docs/assets/diagram-sources/` to keep visuals and text in sync.

## Review

- Open a pull request with a short summary and any screenshots that illustrate the change.
- Verify formatting with the [authoring examples](../reference/authoring-examples.md) before requesting review.

## Publish

- Run `zensical build` to generate the static site.
- Deploy the output to your hosting provider and announce the update in your release channels.
