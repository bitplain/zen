# Getting started

Follow this path to stand up your documentation quickly:

1. [Create a project](../platform/commands.md#quick-start) with the CLI scaffold.
2. Add or adapt content using the [authoring examples](../reference/authoring-examples.md) and the [Markdown primer](../reference/markdown.md).
3. Preview locally with `zensical serve` and iterate on layout, navigation, and assets.
4. Run `zensical build` and deploy the generated site to your preferred host.

## Tips

- Keep screenshots and diagrams in `docs/assets/` to reuse across guides.
- Start a draft in the [FAQ](../faq/index.md) when questions repeat—upgrade it into a full guide later.
- Document repeatable work in [process guides](../processes/content-workflow.md) to onboard new contributors.
